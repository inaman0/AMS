Project Title: Centralized Course Management System

Project Overview:
The Centralized Course Management System is a web application designed to streamline course management for students and administrators (teachers). It provides a centralized platform to manage course registrations, feedback, and semester results while ensuring user-friendly interfaces and efficient backend operations. This system is built using Node.js, EJS for templating, and MySQL as the database.

Features:

User Registration and Authentication:
Both students and administrators can register and log in to the system securely.

Course Registration Management:

Students can view available courses and register
Administrators can add, update, and manage courses in the system.

Feedback Mechanism:
Students can provide structured feedback for courses they are enrolled in.
Administrators can review and analyze student feedback to improve teaching quality.

Historical Data Access:
Students can view their previously submitted course registration details for reference.

Result Portal:

Students can check their semester results through a user-friendly interface.
Administrators can upload semester results for individual students.

Enrollment Overview for Teachers:

Teachers can view a list of students enrolled in specific courses.
Grades can be assigned directly within the system after selecting a course.

Technical Stack:

Frontend:
EJS (Embedded JavaScript): Used as a templating engine to render dynamic HTML pages.

Backend:
Node.js: Handles server-side logic and API endpoints.

Database:
MySQL: Stores all the applicationâ€™s data, including user information, courses, feedback, and results.

How It Works:

Students:
Register or log in to their account.
Browse and register for courses from a dynamically updated list.
View past course registrations and semester results.
Submit feedback for courses.

Administrators (Teachers):
Log in to access administrative features.
Add or modify course details.
Upload semester results for students.
View and analyze student feedback.
Access a list of students enrolled in a course and assign grades.
